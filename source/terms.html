    <h1>RISK DISCLOSURE</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h3>GENERAL</h3>
        <p>

      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>CFD</h3>
        <p>
          CFD stands for a “Contract for Difference”, which means that it is not the underlying asset that you buy but rather a contract to settle the difference between the opening and closing price of the asset. CFD trade is usually a margin trade, which means that you only have to pay a small share of your position’s total cost. This is generally known as “Leverage,” and even insignificant market fluctuations can have a major impact on your trading account – either negative or positive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the market movement is against you, your total loss may exceed the funds invested in a particular position. You are responsible for all losses in your account, up to and including all the funds in your account.
        </p>
        <p>
          CFDs are not suitable for the long-term investor. If you hold CFDs open over a long period of time, the associated costs, such as overnight charges, grow and buying the underlying asset may turn out to be more profitable.
